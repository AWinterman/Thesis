This is a copy of my undergraduate thesis, because when I set up my github account I didn't know what else to put here. 

It's written LaTeX 2e, a markup language, more information here: http://www.latex-project.org/

Any heavy lifting (mathematical or graphical) is done in R.

I don't really expect any one to read it, but if you wanted to you should open TestofEquivalence.pdf

Enjoy!
Andrew
